Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tiago and I'm a frontend developer at <a href="https://seekingalpha.com">Seeking Alpha</a>.

I became invested in programming back in high school when I got my first Texas Instruments, and continued programming on and off since then, even while pursuing a career in international management. In 2013 I decided to shift gears and turn what used to be a hobby into a professional skill, so I created my own brand, took on a couple of projects as a freelancer, built a portfolio, and eventually became a full-time web developer.
